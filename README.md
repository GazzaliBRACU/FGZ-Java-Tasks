# Java Development Environment for Educational Labs

This repository is designed to provide an optimal setup for Java programming lab tasks, utilizing **GitHub Codespaces** to ensure a consistent and accessible development environment for all students. With pre-configured settings and extensions, students can focus on learning and completing assignments without the hassle of environment setup issues.

## Objectives

The development environment in this repository aims to:

1. **Simplify Setup**: Automatically prepare a complete Java development environment in Codespaces, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
2. **Enhance Productivity and Learning**:
   - Pre-install essential Visual Studio Code extensions:
     - **Extension Pack for Java by Microsoft**: Offers comprehensive Java development tools, including IntelliSense, debugging, and project management.
     - **Error Lens**: Improves code readability by highlighting errors and warnings in real-time.
   - Customize editor settings for an improved coding experience:
     - Set the editor's font to `Consolas`, `'Courier New'`, or `monospace` for better readability.
     - Increase the default editor font size to 25 pixels to make text easier to read.
     - Enable mouse wheel zoom for easy font size adjustments.
3. **Avoid Complex Configurations**: Utilize default Codespaces images without the need for custom Docker configurations, making it easy for beginners to start.
